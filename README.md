# Introduction
Whack A Mollie is a spin off from the popular arcade game - Whac-A-Mole. Whac-A-Mole was created in 1975 by the amusements manufacturer TOGO in Japan, where it was originally known as Mogura Taiji (モグラ退治, "Mole Buster") or Mogura Tataki (モグラたたき, "Mole Smash").

A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, soft mallet. Five to eight holes in the play area top are filled with small, plastic, cartoonish moles, or other characters, which pop up at random. Points are scored by, as the name suggests, whacking each mole as it appears.

For this version of Whack A Mollie, beside whacking each mole. At random times, a hamburger will appear which require the player to whack it to get extra points. The story of Mollie the mole begins : 

Mollie is a very cheeky mole living in the northern part of England. She loves to pop into the house to steal your food. What you need to do is to hit Mollie when she appears. She also likes to eat your hamburgers. So when the hamburger appears, take it back from Mollie by clicking on it and you will get extra points.
